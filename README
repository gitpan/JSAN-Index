NAME
    JSAN::Index - A Class::DBI wrapper for the SQLite JSAN Index

DESCRIPTION
    JSAN is the JavaScript Archive Network, a CPAN implementation for
    Javascript.

    You can find the JSAN at <http://openjsan.org>.

    As well as a flat text file index like CPAN, the JSAN index is also
    distributed as a SQLite database.

    "JSAN::Index" is a Class::DBI wrapper built around the JSAN SQLite
    index.

    It allow you to easily do all sorts of nifty things with the index in a
    simple and straight forward way.

STATUS
    This is currently only for the use of JSAN developers, as the index is
    still going through some amount of flux. It should not be used by
    outsiders until the index has stabilised a little and we assign a
    non-devel version

TO DO
    - Check this works once we can roll the actual index

    - Document it all properly

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=JSAN-Index>
